# Stat 587 Homework 2

---
##  Question 1. The authors of a scientific article wrote, “Sixteen rats weighing 150 $\pm$ 10 g were injected...”. 150 g seems to be the average weight of the 16 rats in the sample. The 10 g figure is a little ambiguous and could be interpreted in several different ways.

* 1  If the authors wished to directly convey information about the variation among the weights of the sixteen rats in the sample, should 10 g represent the sample standard deviation or the standard error of the sample average?

- **Answer** *It is the Standard deviation (SD) of this sample.* Standard error(SE) represents the distribution of samples. It is from mean values of samples. In this case, 16 rats belong to one sample.

* 2  Suppose 10 g really represented the standard error of the sample average. What must have been the sample standard deviation of the 16 rats?

- **Answer** $SE =$ \frac{$\sigma$}{\sqrt{n}}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
